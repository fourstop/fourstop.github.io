									<h3 style="font-size:15px; font-weight:300; line-height: 1.4; color:#484f5e;">
									The founding partners of 4Stop already had a background in the payments and risk management space. Having worked in executive positions at different acquiring banks, marketplaces, and large-scale eCommerce businesses, they felt a constant need to improve the compliance, anti-fraud and risk management features at each and every level.
									<br><Br>
									Know Your Customer (KYC) for regulatory requirements continues to evolve both in the terms of due-diligence required and the level of complexity in which it is performed. Financial institutions, banks and their customers are constantly managing the ever-changing regulatory landscape and trying to find new streamlined and cost-effective methods to integrate changes when they occur. </h3>

							<div class="col-md-12" style="background-color:#f5fbfc;">
									<h3 style="font-size:18px; font-weight:300; line-height: 1.4; color:#05afce;"><br>According to 4Stop’s Chief Regulatory Officer Alvaro Kurth, <em>“While compliance is not an option but a legal requirement, these businesses must integrate processes that satisfy the regulator, while still delivering a positive customer experience.”</em></h3>

							<div class="col-md-12 topmargin-sm">
									<h3 style="font-size:15px; font-weight:300; line-height: 1.4; color:#484f5e;">However, the primary obstacle in setting-up a streamlined risk-based approach and a globally scalable set of data providers for compliant KYC procedures is the challenge of having to integrate various data providers at different touch points in the customer experience. Traditionally this has been solved by various API integrations, Backoffice Management Systems and the teams under a leadership approach applying a patched work around to establish thorough KYC or risk checks on clients and transactions.
									<br><br>
									The founding members of 4Stop wanted to establish a solution. A single API integration that provided a single Backoffice Management System with robust flexibility to enable global data sources in real-time, coupled with advanced risk management tools, such as real-time dynamic rule sets. “We did not know what will all change in the coming years, however one thing was certain, that change will be on-going as the regulating bodies in the various verticals related to online payments continue to tighten their rules and regulations framework to move closer to a fully supervised and compliant payment ecosystem,” said 4Stops CEO Ingo Ernst in a statement.

									<h3 style="font-size:15px; font-weight:300; line-height: 1.4; color:#484f5e;">
									4Stop is distinguishing itself from its industry competitors by solely focusing on providing global KYC for compliance, in a fail-safe, future-proof, simplistic, and real-time manner.

								<em>“The market was not ready at the time we were looking to expand globally. The entry level barriers and sales cycles were still high and long because businesses like marketplaces, financial institutions and large players in various verticals did not feel the regulatory pressure to implement global KYC and compliance procedures and data sources.
